Logic components perform work without normal UI chrome. They expose specialized,
reference-counted interfaces and the same immutable operation contract used by
graph runs. A future Tool Canvas represents these operations with discoverable
cards and ports; drawing a connector alone never executes behavior.

The current standalone operations are:

| Interface/factory | Inputs → outputs | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| INyxJSONParse / NewNyxJSONParse | Text → JSON | Strict JSON admission, preserving exact number spellings, Unicode and NUL |
| INyxJSONSelect / NewNyxJSONSelect | JSON → JSON | Typed Field/Item selection, sharing the resource selector contract |
| INyxJSONFormat / NewNyxJSONFormat | JSON → Text | Compact or indented output with field order and exact numeric/text values retained |
| INyxTextJoin / NewNyxTextJoin | Text + Text → Text | Caller-defined separator; exact text without behavioral string interpretation |

Direct Pascal calls need no canvas, interpreter, document or scheduler:

```pascal
LProfile := NewNyxJSONSelect(NyxDataPath.Field('profile'))
  .Select(NewNyxJSONParse.Parse(LSourceText));
LPretty := NewNyxJSONFormat(njlIndented, 2).Format(LProfile);
```

Every operation publishes a copied descriptor: distinct kind reference, English
title/help, intent group, creator labels, affinity and exact input/output ports.
These are reusable discovery contracts; they do not yet constitute the Studio
Logic toolbox or its inspector. Creators implement INyxLogicOperation on their
own reference-counted base, with immutable configuration and schema.

Text, Boolean, Integer, exact decimal Number, structured JSON, Bytes and Signal
have separate value families. Port and step references compare exact Unicode
names independently; punctuation has no delimiter meaning. Signals are invocation
tokens, never fabricated from Boolean/null data. Inputs have one producer per
invocation; outputs may fan out. No implicit JSON/text or numeric conversions occur.

NewNyxFlowGraph builds a reusable immutable DAG:

```pascal
LGraph := NewNyxFlowGraph
  .WithStep(NyxFlowStep('parse'), NewNyxJSONParse)
  .WithStep(NyxFlowStep('format'), NewNyxJSONFormat)
  .Connect(
    NyxFlowEndpoint(NyxFlowStep('parse'), NyxLogicPort(nlpJSON)),
    NyxFlowEndpoint(NyxFlowStep('format'), NyxLogicPort(nlpJSON)))
  .Build;
```

Build captures independent vectors, configuration and complete port descriptors.
It validates topology; cycles currently refuse and require a future explicit
feedback runner. Each step executes once in deterministic topological/declaration
order. Each run supplies all unwired required inputs. Unknown, mistyped, duplicate
or wired invocation inputs refuse before operations enter. Alternative operations
must return exactly their declared output frame. Failure identifies the step and
exposes no partially successful result. Previously completed results stay independent.

Graph.ToData and NyxFlowGraphFromData form a versioned standalone persistence
boundary. Built-in recovery invokes only the typed factories above. Custom kinds
require an explicit INyxLogicResolver; kind, configuration and complete descriptor
must agree, so recovery cannot silently reinterpret a saved port signature.

Documents own named immutable declarations through `Document.Flows`. A declaration
contains copied schema/configuration and connections, without retaining executable
operations, a resolver or host authority. `Definition(...).Build` explicitly creates
a runtime graph; unknown creator kinds require the caller's resolver. Clones and
focused page/reusable builds retain independent registry membership. A retained
definition can outlive its document.

```pascal
LDocument.Flows.Define(NyxFlowRef('Format profile'), LGraph);
LRuntimeGraph := LDocument.Flows.Definition(NyxFlowRef('Format profile')).Build;
```

Design version 14 saves these declarations alongside preceding typed families.
Documents without graphs retain their earlier minimal encoding. Older opaque
`flows` fields stay opaque; conflicting promotion refuses before publication.
The registry admits at most 64 definitions, each at most 1 MiB of UTF-8 wire data.

Generated Pascal uses typed factories, enums, paths and fluent graph construction.
Creator-only configuration is an explicit data boundary; its generated declaration
cannot execute until resolved. Literal admission reconstructs declarations without
invoking operations. Targeted handwritten continuation changes only named graphs
whose configuration changed, preserving unrelated helpers/computed definitions;
unexpressed registry reordering refuses whole-candidate equality. Ordinary paired
history retains accepted source/design and pending draft guards. This integration
does not expose the Studio Logic toolbox or semantic graph authoring.

TNyxFlowLimits.Defaults supplies 128 steps, 512 wires, 1 MiB per encoded value and
8 MiB per run. Fluent limits are caller-tunable within admitted finite ceilings.
The run counts invocation values and each produced value once, independent of
fan-out. Limits do not establish peak-memory, frame latency or arbitrary host-work
deadlines. JSON formatting cooperatively checks cancellation between emitted pieces.
Entered custom/blocking operations must cooperate themselves.

TNyxFlowExecution.Submit reuses Nyx's scheduler/query execution. UIQueue defers on
both targets; native Threaded uses a real worker, and browser Threaded refuses.
Asynchronous follows scheduler capability. UI-affinity operations refuse real
worker policies. Pure affinity is a creator promise about independent immutable,
thread-safe implementation state, not something a flag proves.

TNyxFlowApplication.Submit captures an active weak application context, exact
state identity/revision and page generation. Typed NyxFlowAssign overloads map
outputs to existing scalar state references. One ordinary State.Apply publishes
the complete group, and normal bindings update existing controls. Workers retain
only immutable graph/inputs; the UI courier owns the weak publication capability.
Destination admission reads an owned state snapshot. Creator getters are retained
and copied in a defined order; reentrant application retirement refuses before
live state is dereferenced or work is adopted.
JSON and bytes need explicit transformations before scalar publication. Exact
decimal outputs require canonical IEEE spelling for Number state; other spellings
or precision loss refuse instead of silently rounding. Explicit conversion coverage
remains required.

Cancellation combines explicit run cancellation and owning view retirement.
Pending work skips entry; entered graph/operation checkpoints revoke later steps
and publication. Cooperative cancellation is a cancelled outcome rather than a
compute failure. Stale state refuses the whole publication; navigation/disposal
revokes it. Dropping the run does not cancel it. Grouped output atomicity does not
roll back explicit host/UI side effects or a State observer that commits then throws.

The maintained command executes native shared and actual LCL application checks
and stages matched browser consumers for explicit HTTP execution:

```powershell
./tools/build.ps1 -Target logic-flow -LogicFlowEvidenceDirectory build/logic-flow/review
```

The English application connects parse/select/pretty/compact/join to real buttons,
a bound memo and result controls. It exercises multiple callback registrations,
native worker/browser event-loop publication, independent applications, failures,
pending/entered cancellation, stale state and page retirement. WORK.md records
exact counts, inspected desktop/narrow captures and limits.

Full coverage remains required: files/dialogs, HTTP, LINQ sorting/filtering/mapping,
regex/text transforms, data conversions, flow/timers, explicit feedback, script and
control-port discovery, automatic control/event routes, interactive Tool Canvas wiring,
bounded semantic authoring and preserving delivery. Hosted resource and user
activation/authority semantics belong to their existing adapters. This foundation
does not close those criteria or replace functional results with metadata cards.

`tools/build.ps1 -Target logic-document -LogicDocumentEvidenceDirectory <directory>`
qualifies saved declarations, source/history, exact compiled base and handwritten
continuation companions, and ordinary native controls. It stages matching browser
consumers; WORK.md distinguishes their actual HTTP execution from compilation.
